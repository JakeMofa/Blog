                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>Learning and Creating New Innovation is my passion</p>
              </div>
              <p> Hello!</p>
              <p>Hello!, My Name Is Jake Mofa, And I Am A Python Developer Who Has Expertise In Back End Development, Learning And Discovering The Aspects Of A Front-End Developer, While Striving To Do Full Stack Development.<br>
              <br>But I Still Consider My Self As An Inspired Softwaer Engineer Always Ready To Learn Everything Haha! And Push My Self Beyond And Surpassing My Limit </p>
              <p>Currently, I am Based in the Bay Area of California, to be precise Let's Say San Francisco HaHa!, But before i came to California, I studied,lived, and obtained my degree in a place in Africa Called Cameroon.</p>
              <p>In Cameroon, i lived in a city called Douala, and  while in Douala, i lived and grew, while i studied my education system in a diffrent region in Cameroon. Despite that The area where i grew up in or rather Cameroon is known to be Bilingual  with French and English</p>
              <p> And It was rather unfortunate that the place where i grew up in was an only frecnh  speaking zone, so i was compelled to learn,and undertand french, It wasn't really like i had any choice Haha!.</p>
              <div class = "title">
                
                <h2>What Prompted me to Start Coding?</h2>
                <img src = "images/walk.gif" alt = "">
                
              </div>
              <p>Well While in Cameroon, i knew i had to decide to pick a major, which at first i was uncertain about, and originally i chose to be a Mechanical Engineer, but after a few years, giving it some thought i fell in love with Technology and wanted to do something diffrent</p>
              <p>Falling in Love with Technology may sound easier as it sounds,but by then just probally because i may have watched a movie called "Hacker" and i realised that the whole world revolves around Evolution and Man is Bound to change, meaning everything is being Digitalized.</p>
              <p>That's When i then decided to make a split-decison and evision my seld with a diffrent major as a software engineer, but long and behold i should have pictured what i was getting my self into.</p>
              <p>The first Programming Language which i got into and started programming with was the Basic and fundamentals of C++, it was then after i studied and did C++, that i did some research and started learning Python.</p>
              <p>While Python being my  second to first langugae i stuck with it, mastered it did multiple projects and concurrently still used python in my every day life, work, building scripts, automation testing, integrating and many more.</p>
              <p>But then i realised being a Python Developer alone,and just knowing python wouldn't get me know where, that's when i started learning Python Frameworks and it's corresponsive popular library that is currently wanted by most employers</p>
              <p>Oh and how i learnt these languages, well while studying in Cameroon, they taught us our first language which was C++ which was the mere basics but i didn't see my self progressing or going anywhere with C++ that's what prompted me then to learn Python</p>
              <p>Upon learning Python, i then learnt how to automate scripts using automation, then i rapidly progressed, using python to webscrape, using selenium, beautiful soup, conjure and configure API's.</p>
              <p>But once i got a mastery of Python my thirst for knowledge was still not satisfied and after doing some research, i aquired that  most Software engineers need to posses both front end skills, back end skills and also have a wide range of Databases,REST API's And Cloud System.</p>
              <p>And you bet it that's exactly what i did, aquired knowledge of Js frameworks, such as react and nodejs and python frameworks such as Django and Flask, combining these knowledge now able to build full sclaed websites. </p>
